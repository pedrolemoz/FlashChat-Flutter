## What I learned with this project?

This project gave me an opportunity to create a real application that is able to retrive and send data through Firebase, with Cloud Firestore API.
I learned a lot about asynchonous programming in Dart, and how to use Streams (and StreamBuilder) to listen to changes in my database.
I also realized how complicated is to synchonize date and time between differents timezones, and how to fix common errors with this.
